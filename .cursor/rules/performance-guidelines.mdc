## Real-time Processing Requirements

### Voice Recognition
- Maximum latency: 300ms
- Audio buffer size: 100ms
- Sample rate: 24kHz
- Bit depth: 16-bit
- Channels: Mono

### Macro Execution
- Command response time: < 50ms
- Input simulation accuracy: 99.9%
- Maximum concurrent macros: 10
- Memory usage per macro: < 1MB

## Resource Usage Limits

### CPU Usage
- Main process: < 15%
- Background services: < 5%
- Audio processing: < 10%
- Total system impact: < 30%

### Memory Management
- Total application: < 200MB
- Audio buffer: < 50MB
- Cache size: < 100MB
- Garbage collection optimization required

## Optimization Strategies

### Audio Processing
- Use circular buffers
- Implement voice activity detection
- Optimize FFT calculations
- Cache frequently used audio segments

### GPT-4o Integration
- Streaming response handling
- Batch processing when possible
- Cache API responses
- Implement retry with backoff

### Database Operations
- Use prepared statements
- Index frequently queried fields
- Implement query caching
- Regular vacuum and optimization

## Monitoring and Profiling

### Performance Metrics
- Track API response times
- Monitor memory usage
- Log CPU utilization
- Measure command latency

### Debugging Tools
- Use memory profilers
- CPU usage analysis
- Network traffic monitoring
- Performance regression testing
